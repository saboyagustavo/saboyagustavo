### Hello, world!
---
  I formerly graduated in Art Direction, an area of knowledge that allowed me to improve strategic vision and critical sense, vital skills to find solutions with creativity and planning.<br/>
  Always curious and a lover of new technologies, **in early 2020 I shifted my career to IT**. <br/>
  Following a genuine stubborn interest in how things are made and work, I let the questions sprout as I look forward to learning _more_.
