### Hello, world!
---
  Fomerly graduated in Art Direction, area of knowledge that allowed me to improve strategic vision and critical sense, vital skills to find solutions with creativity and planning. Always curious and a lover of new technologies, **in early 2020 I've shifted career to IT** and delved into the JavaScript ecosystem.  
Following a genuine stubborn interest of how things are made and work, I let the questions sprout as I look foward to learn __more__.
