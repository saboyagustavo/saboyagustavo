### Hello, world!
---
  Fomerly graduated in Art Direction, area of knowledge that allowed me to improve strategic vision and critical sense, vital skills to find solutions with creativity and planning. Always curious and a lover of new technologies, **in early 2020 I've shifted career to IT** and delved into the JavaScript ecosystem.  
Following a genuine stubborn interest of how things are made and work, I let the questions sprout as I look foward to learn __more__.
### What's up?
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying System Analysis and Development
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently [open to work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saboyagustavo/);
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Web Development with
